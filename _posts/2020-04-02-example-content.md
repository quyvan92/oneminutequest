Glass road is a resource converting euro that has you watching your opponent's to optimise the timing of your actions.

It's like Agricola meets broom service with a unique twist on resource management.

Choose 5 cards.

Play a card, if you're opponent chose a similar card, get half you actions.

Optimise your resource management with a unique dial mechanism.

Buy and place buildings like a puzzle that do cool things like castles of burgundy.

Beginners will focus more on the puzzle optimization, more advanced players will focus more on player interactions
